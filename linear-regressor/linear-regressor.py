# Regression is used to find out the relationship between input data and the continuously-valued output data. This is
# generally represented as real numbers, and our aim is to estimate the core function that calculates the mapping
# from the input to the output.

# 1 --> 2
# 3 --> 6
# 4.3 --> 8.6
# 7.1 --> 14.2
# this matches this function: f(x) = 2(x)

# When we build a machine learning model, we need a way to validate our model and check whether it is performing at a
# satisfactory level. To do this, we need to separate our data into two groupsâ€”a training dataset and a testing
# dataset. The training dataset will be used to build the model, and the testing dataset will be used to see how this
# trained model performs on unknown data. So, let's go ahead and split this data into training and testing datasets:

num_training = int(0.8 * len(x))
num_test = len(x) - num_training

# Training data

x_train = np.array(x[:num_training]).reshape((num_training, 1))
y_train = np.array(y[:num_training])

# Test data

x_test = np.array(x[num_training:]).reshape((num_test, 1))
y_test = np.array(y[num_training:])

# Create linear regressor object

linear_regressor = linear_model.LinearRegression()

# Train the model using the training sets

linear_regressor.fit(x_train, y_train)
y_train_pred = linear_regressor.predict(x_train)

# To plot training outputs, we will use the matplotlib

plt.figure()
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, color='orange')
plt.plot(x_train, y_train_pred, color='blue', linewidth=4)
plt.title('Training data')
plt.show()

# To plot test output

y_test_pred = linear_regressor.predict(x_test)
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(x_test, y_test, color='green')
plt.plot(x_test, y_test_pred, color='black', linewidth=4)
plt.title('Test data')
plt.show()
